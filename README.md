This is an android application and This system aims to quick access to various nhce websites. The application becomes also a Mobile version of our official website .

The project involves the development of an android application and the system aims to provide quick access to various NHCE web. The application is a mobile version of the College’s official website. Mobile phones and android applications play a major role in human lives, from being an ordinary talking device to a human companion. With the downfall of websites and the potent rise of handy mobile applications, it is time to transit from conventional website development to Application development. The trend of which is evidently rising. The project introduces an Application Software which provides a convenient and expedient user interface.!

The difficulty of access to the various resources in the official website is one of the main advantages and driving reasons towards the development of this application. The website is cumbersome for some and the notifications often do not reach the intended audience, and that is where the applications push notifications come in. The ability to contact developers if needed further fuels the development in the positive direction; whereas other websites do not often take in the feedback of its users at all.

The requirement of needing to be online all the time to access various resources is also a hindrance for some since some details about the college shouldn’t require internet at all. The further convenience of being able to easily open an application and lookup for the desired information is another win for the application department and can be considered as a huge ease of use for the user.
